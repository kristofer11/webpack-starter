Vanilla Javascript exercise where I build an app that keeps track of to-do lists for the user.

User stories: I can create new collections (or folders or projects). I can add tasks within each collection. I can set a due date for each task. I can set a priority level for each task. I can edit or delete a task after it has been created.
